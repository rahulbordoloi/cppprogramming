/*
stringstream is a stream class to operate on strings. It basically implements input/output operations on memory (string) based streams. stringstream can be helpful in different type of parsing. The following operators/functions are commonly used here

Operator >> Extracts formatted data.
Operator << Inserts formatted data.
Method str() Gets the contents of underlying string device object.
Method str(string) Sets the contents of underlying string device object.
Its header file is sstream.

One common use of this class is to parse comma-separated integers from a string (e.g., "23,4,56").

stringstream ss("23,4,56");
char ch;
int a, b, c;
ss >> a >> ch >> b >> ch >> c;  // a = 23, b = 4, c = 56
You have to complete the function vector parseInts(string str). str will be a string consisting of comma-separated integers, and you have to return a vector of int representing the integers.

Note If you want to know how to push elements in a vector, solve the first problem in the STL chapter.

Input Format

The first and only line consists of n integers separated by commas.

Output Format

Print the integers after parsing it.

P.S.: I/O will be automatically handled. You need to complete the function only.

Sample Input

23,4,56
Sample Output

23
4
56
